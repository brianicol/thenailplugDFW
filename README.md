<h2>About my journey</h2>

<p>My interest in nails was sparked during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I began looking at tutorials on YouTube and eventually made my first nail supply purchase at Nail Supply Glamour in Dallas, TX. I practiced on myself a lot with all the downtime I had and eventually began practicing on my close relatives. As time passed, I researched many schools in hopes of pursuing a proper career in the beauty industry. I stumbled across Sol Nail Academy and enrolled in classes within months after beginning my nail journey.</p>
