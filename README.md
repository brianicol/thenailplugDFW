<h2>About my journey</h2>

<p>I started doing nails during the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
My first purchase of nail supplies was from Nail Supply Glamour. 
This is a local nail supply store located in the heart of Dallas, TX. 
I started practicing on myself and used Instagram Explore page for inspiration,
Within 3 months I began practicing on my close relatives and eventually enrolled in cosmotology school at Sol Nail Academy.</p>
